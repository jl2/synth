This is the very beginning of a rudimentary synthesizer program.  Right now it just plays sine waves of various frequencies in response to keyboard input, but I plan on adding several more features.


Right now keys 'a','s','d','f','v','t','y','n','j','k','l' and ';' play sound.  Pitch increases left to right.


Things I want to add or fix:
   * Use real notes.
   * Improved sound quality
   * Save and restore of songs
   * Map the keyboard to piano keys somehow
   * Some kind of visualization
